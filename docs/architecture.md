# Alpha-Q Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

Alpha-Q is built with a modular, extensible architecture that follows clean code principles and separation of concerns.

### Core Components

1. **Web Application Layer**
   - Flask-based web server
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - WebSocket support for real-time features
   - JWT-based authentication
   - CORS support for cross-origin requests

2. **Database Layer**
   - Supabase integration for primary database
   - SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
   - Migration management with Flask-Migrate
   - Backup and restore functionality
   - Vector store for AI model embeddings

3. **AI/ML Layer**
   - Hugging Face Transformers integration
   - Model management and versioning
   - Resource monitoring and optimization
   - Cloud offloading to Google Colab
   - Model caching and persistence

4. **System Management**
   - Resource monitoring (CPU, Memory, GPU)
   - Process management
   - Cloud integration
   - Backup and recovery
   - Logging and monitoring

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Modularity**
   - Each component is self-contained
   - Clear interfaces between modules
   - Easy to extend and maintain
   - Plugin architecture for new features

2. **Scalability**
   - Cloud offloading for heavy computations
   - Resource-aware model loading
   - Efficient database operations
   - Caching strategies

3. **Security**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Environment variable management
   - Secure API endpoints
   - Input validation
   - Rate limiting

4. **Reliability**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Automatic backup system
   - Health monitoring
   - Graceful degradation

## Data Flow

1. **User Request Flow**
   ```
   Client Request
   → Authentication
   → Request Validation
   → Business Logic
   → Database Operation
   → Response Generation
   → Client Response
   ```

2. **AI Model Flow**
   ```
   Model Request
   → Resource Check
   → Model Selection
   → Load/Cache Model
   → Process Request
   → Return Results
   ```

3. **System Monitoring Flow**
   ```
   Resource Check
   → Metrics Collection
   → Threshold Check
   → Action Trigger
   → Status Update
   → Logging
   ```
